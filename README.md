Hackers don‚Äôt sleep ‚Äî and neither does my curiosity. I‚Äôm Huy Tang, a cybersecurity professional obsessed with understanding threats before they strike. Through real-world experience and personal projects, I turn theory into action by hunting threats, closing vulnerabilities, and building secure systems that can stand up to modern attacks.

Here, you‚Äôll find hands-on projects that showcase my work in vulnerability management, incident response, and threat detection using tools like Tenable, Microsoft Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint, and PowerShell automation. Whether I‚Äôm reducing attack surfaces or scripting my way to faster remediation, my focus is simple: protect what matters.

If you‚Äôre looking for someone who can combine deep technical skill with a proactive security mindset, dive in ‚Äî the work speaks for itself.
